# minetest_forge

Huge electric arc furnaces for minetest, with non-renewable finite-liquids-like molten ores and metals.

Crafts
======

First make refractory clay:

Refractory clay can also be made from slag:

Then craft refractory brick blocks

Build a crucible where the bottom can be accessed. I used mesecon sticky pistons for gates.
Place the electrode in the top, give it a lot of juice, and punch to turn it on. But before that fill the crucible with ore.

Molten ore will flow out of hols created in the bottom and eventually cool. Be careful, molten ore will destroy most materials. Use the refractory bricks.

Ores
======
Input materials and what you might get out of them. Yields vary; some things result in mostly slag.

* desert cobble: copper, steel
* stone cobble: steel, copper
* gravel: steel, gold
* dirt: steel, gold
* desert sand: glass
* sand: glass
* sandstone: glass

Metal blocks can be remelted without loss. Reprocessing slag over and over may yield small returns.
